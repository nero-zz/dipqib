  Symmetry generally conveys two primary meanings. The first is an imprecise
  sense of harmonious or aesthetically pleasing proportionality and balance on
  either side of an axis; such that it reflects beauty or perfection. The
  second meaning is a precise and well-defined concept of balance or "patterned
  self-similarity" that can be demonstrated or proved according to the rules of
  a formal system: by geometry or through physics.
